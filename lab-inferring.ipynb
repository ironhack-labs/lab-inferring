    "Step 2: One Page Report Summarizing the Findings\n",
    "1. Experiment Overview:\n",
    "The exercise aimed to infer various aspects from a product review and a news article using prompt engineering with OpenAI's GPT model. The tasks ranged from sentiment analysis and emotion detection to extracting specific information like product names, brand names, and topics. We tried three versions of prompts to cover different types of inference tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Observations:\n",
    "Version 1 (Sentiment and Emotion Extraction):\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was highly accurate in identifying the sentiment of the product review as \"positive.\"\n",
    "It also correctly identified relevant emotions such as satisfaction, appreciation, and frustration (due to missing parts), although the limit of five emotions helped keep the list concise.\n",
    "For checking anger, the model correctly inferred that there was no expression of anger, given that the reviewer was generally satisfied with the customer service.\n",
    "Version 2 (Product and Brand Name Extraction):\n",
    "\n",
    "The model successfully extracted the product name (\"lamp\") and the company name (\"Lumina\") from the review text. However, if the review was more ambiguous or did not explicitly mention the company name, this could lead to \"unknown\" values in the output.\n",
    "Version 3 (Inferring Topics from a News Article):\n",
    "\n",
    "The model accurately matched the relevant topics from the news article. It identified \"NASA,\" \"employee satisfaction,\" and \"federal government\" as valid topics, but correctly excluded unrelated topics like \"engineering\" and \"local government.\"\n",
    "The ability to automatically generate a dictionary with binary values for each topic worked well for categorizing the text in a structured way.\n",
    "3. Challenges:\n",
    "Hallucinations: The model tends to hallucinate or infer incorrect details when asked to guess or fill in gaps. For example, if product or company names are not explicitly mentioned, the model might invent names.\n",
    "Ambiguity: In cases where the reviewer doesn't explicitly state a sentiment or emotion, the model sometimes struggles to make a reliable inference, especially with mixed reviews that contain both positive and negative aspects.\n",
    "4. Key Learnings:\n",
    "Prompt Specificity: The more specific and structured the prompt, the better the output. For example, when the output is expected in JSON format, the response is clean and easy to process programmatically.\n",
    "Efficiency in Extraction: The model is very effective at extracting multiple aspects from a single text in one go, such as sentiment, product, and brand, which saves time compared to processing them separately.\n",
    "Context Sensitivity: The model performs well in contextually understanding the reviewer's tone and satisfaction level. It can distinguish between the overall sentiment and nuanced emotions, making it a strong tool for analyzing customer feedback.\n",
    "In conclusion, while GPT-3.5 is highly effective in inference tasks, it requires well-structured prompts to prevent hallucination and ensure accurate extraction of information.\n",
