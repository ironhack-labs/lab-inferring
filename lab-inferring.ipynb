    "## Lab Report: Inferring with GPT\n",
    "## Experiment Summary and Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "This report summarizes experiments conducted using GPT to analyze text and infer various aspects including sentiment, topics, and workplace dynamics from a given story about NASA and government employee satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experimental Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Topic Analysis**\n",
    "   - Tested GPT's ability to identify main topics from text\n",
    "   - Successfully identified key themes like \"NASA\", \"employee satisfaction\"\n",
    "   - Format: Simple comma-separated list\n",
    "   - Accuracy: Generally reliable for obvious topics\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sentiment and Emotion Analysis**\n",
    "   - Analyzed emotional undertones and workplace culture\n",
    "   - Format: Structured output with emotions, culture aspects, and ratings\n",
    "   - Results were consistent with human interpretation\n",
    "   - Particularly strong at identifying positive sentiments\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Comparative Department Analysis**\n",
    "   - Created structured comparisons between departments\n",
    "   - Format: Table-style output comparing metrics\n",
    "   - Effectively highlighted contrasts between agencies\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Format Consistency**\n",
    "   - Initial JSON formatting caused parsing issues\n",
    "   - Solution: Simplified to basic comma-separated format\n",
    "   - Learning: Clear, simple formatting instructions work better\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Interpretation**\n",
    "   - GPT occasionally included information not explicitly stated\n",
    "   - Example: When asked about engineering topics, sometimes inferred presence without direct mentions\n",
    "   - Learning: Need to be specific about inference vs. explicit mention\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Response Reliability**\n",
    "   - More reliable when:\n",
    "     - Given specific formatting instructions\n",
    "     - Asked for factual rather than interpretive analysis\n",
    "     - Provided with clear evaluation criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Learnings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prompt Engineering**\n",
    "   - Clear, structured prompts produce more reliable results\n",
    "   - Including example formats improves output consistency\n",
    "   - Breaking complex tasks into smaller components helps accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Processing**\n",
    "   - Simple data formats are easier to work with\n",
    "   - Important to validate and clean GPT outputs\n",
    "   - String parsing requires careful error handling\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Best Practices**\n",
    "   - Always verify GPT's inferences against source text\n",
    "   - Use structured prompts for consistent results\n",
    "   - Include specific formatting instructions\n",
    "   - Test multiple prompt variations for optimal results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "GPT demonstrated strong capabilities in topic identification and sentiment analysis, but required careful prompt engineering for optimal results. The most successful approaches used clear formatting instructions and specific evaluation criteria. Future work could focus on improving reliability for more complex analytical tasks.\n"
